					<p>This website is a place for me to catalog my Clone Hero custom song charts. If you don't know what Clone Hero is or what a 'custom song chart' is then don't worry. I'll explain it a little bit here.</p>

					<header>WHAT IS CLONE HERO?</header>
					<p><a href="https://clonehero.net/" target="_blank"> Clone Hero</a>  is a community made game, made in the <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank"> Unity engine</a>. It's designed to replicate the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero" target="_blank"> Guitar Hero</a>.</p>

					<header>WHAT IS GUITAR HERO?</header>
					<p>Guitar Hero is a series of music rhythm game video games first released in 2005, in which players use a guitar-shaped game controller to simulate playing primarily lead, bass guitar, and rhythm guitar across numerous songs. Players match notes that scroll on-screen to colored fret buttons on the controller, strumming the controller in time to the music in order to score points.</p>

				<div class="faq_qanda">
					<header>WHAT ARE CUSTOM "CHARTS" / SONGS?</header>
					<p>Charting simply means to place notes on the path (highway) that match with the song the user will be playing. So a "custom chart" just means that a community user made that song, rather than an official source like the Guitar Hero or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band_(video_game)" target="_blank"> Rock Band</a> game files. Anyone can make a custom chart of anything! <a href="https://youtu.be/ozXMsFZMydw" target="_blank"> I've seen people make charts that follow the cadence of speech from a Simpsons meme.</a></p>
	
					<p>This is an example of what a song being charted looks like (This is from my upcoming chart "Department of Eagles - Phantom Other").</p>
