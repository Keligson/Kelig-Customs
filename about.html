			<p>I'm Kelig, I'm grown man who likes to play with plastic guitars in his room. I don't have much charting experience but I've always dreamed of re-creating my favorite songs in the Guitar Hero format.</p>

			<p>I like a lot of different music so my completed, in-progress and future charts are quite all over the place genre wise.</p>
			
			<p>So far I've only fully completed two custom charts. The first being <a href="myCharts.html #outGettingRibsChart">'King Krule - Out Getting Ribs'</a>. I need to re-visit it to edit the timings slightly as I was getting the hang of the BPM function. The second is <a href="myCharts.html #theLookChart">'Metronomy - The Look'</a>. I'm still quite pleased with this chart. It was fairly easy to make because it had a lot of repetative parts. I also had a better understanding of the BPM function. I would say it's the most pin point I've been so far when it comes to note timings.</p>
			
			<p>I have plans to make more custom charts. I'll be cataloging my past, present and future charts on the <a href="myCharts.html">'Custom Charts'</a> page along with links to download them and video previews. I might also experiement with a rating and comments section.</p>
			
			<p>That's all for now. I hope you enjoy my charts! If you wish to contact me about anything, <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
